# SAND

***Time grains in blocks.***

SAND is a design-centric productivity tool inspired by the mechanics of an hourglass. It inherits the minimalist DNA of macOS Reminders while evolving into a powerful, multi-list Kanban interface.

SAND 是一款受沙漏启发、具有像素美学的生产力工具。它继承了 MacOS Reminders 的极简设计语言，并将其进化为强大的多列看板界面。通过独特的像素级时间进度条，SAND 提醒你每一粒时间的流逝。

**Time Visualization**: The header features a signature Pixel Progress Bar. It deconstructs the current month into individual grains: **Black** for the past, **Yellow** for the present, and **Gray** for the future.

**时间可视化**：顶部独特的像素进度条（ProgressBar）将当前月份拆解为 31 个颗粒，黑色代表过去，黄色代表当下，灰色代表未来。

**Minimalist Flow**: SAND strips away the clutter, focusing on the movement of tasks between columns—much like sand moving through a glass.

**极致简约**：摒弃繁琐，专注于任务本身在不同看板之间的流动。
