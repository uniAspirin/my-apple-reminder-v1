# My Apple Reminder V1

apple reminder has a very good ui/ux design which could even make it into a Kanban, so I made some adjustment base on the MacOS reminder, including:

1. Show multiple lists in the same view.
2. More flexible drag&drop function and delete area
3. Easy to export / copy as plain text
